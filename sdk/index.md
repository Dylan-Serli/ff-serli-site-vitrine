# FF Serli SDKs

FF Serli provides two official SDKs that are **fully compliant with the [OpenFeature](https://openfeature.dev)** specification:

- A **Server SDK** for backend applications
- A **Client SDK** for frontend or browser-based applications

Both SDKs let you evaluate feature flags in your application with minimal configuration and maximum flexibility.

## Why use the FF Serli SDKs?

Using our SDKs allows you to:

- Evaluate feature flags in real-time
- Use a familiar and standardized interface thanks to OpenFeature
- Avoid API boilerplate and handle fallback logic with ease

Whether you're building a backend service or a modern frontend app, youâ€™ll find a streamlined experience to integrate feature flags seamlessly.

## Server vs Client SDK

|             | Server SDK                       | Client SDK                   |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Runtime     | Node.js, Deno, Bun, etc.         | Browser, React, Vue, etc.    |
| Use Case    | Backend logic, API routing, auth | UI toggles, user experiences |

## Getting Started

To dive into integration, choose the SDK that matches your use case:

- ðŸ‘‰ [Server SDK](./server) â€” For Node.js or other server-side runtimes
- ðŸ‘‰ [Client SDK](./client) â€” For frontend applications

Each SDK section will guide you through installation, setup, and usage examples.


## Not using our SDKs?

No problem!
You can still use the [FF Serli API](../api/index) directly.

Our system is designed to be flexible and platform-agnostic â€” use what works best for you.
